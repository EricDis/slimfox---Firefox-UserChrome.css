# slimfox---Firefox-UserChrome.css
A simple UserChrome.css file to make the Firefox browser slimmer, and gain more space for the actual webcontent.

**What is it?**
This is a UserChrome.css file. This sort of file lets you modify the appearance of the Firefox browser.
This is my personal UserChrome.css which mainly aims to not waste any Screenspace.

**How to use it...**
Simply put this file to your profile folder or copy and paste the code into your UserChrome.css file.

**1.** Locate your profiles folder. It should end with ".default"
On Windows usually: [DRIVE]/Users/[USER]/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/...
Or
Start Firefox > click on the Burgermenu (usually top right) > click help > click Information troubleshooting > a tab opens, there click on "open folder" in the profile section
Or
Click on the Windows Start button > put "%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\" into the search field > the profiles folder should open

There get into the "chrome" folder... if there is no such folder, just make one.

**2.** Put the code into your UserChrome.css file.
If there is no such file in the chrome folder, make a file called "UserChrome.css" or just download this one and put it there.

**3.** Start Firefox > open a new tab > type "about:config" into the urlbar > skip warning > type "userprof" into the searchfield > set the value of "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" to true by double clicking it.

**4.** Done - just restart.
